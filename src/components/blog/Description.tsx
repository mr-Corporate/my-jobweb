         <p className='font-mono text-slate-700 text-2xl'>Let’s dive in & explore</p>

         <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Updated resume is a must! </p>
         <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>Your resume speaks for you in an organisation where no one knows you. And you need to raise the volume by
             updating the CV regularly. Ensure that you mention all the experiences with proper joining and release dates
              and details, your skills and education, etc. Never dare to underestimate the value of an updated and perfect
               resume; it lays your first impression when you go for aninterview. Sometimes the HRs don’t put effort into
                going through your resume, 
            so also ensure that you keep your point clear and in a highlighted manner through your CV.</p>

            <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Use your network for better reach </p>
            <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>People around are the best help. Your network can help you get the right job
             and reach the right company through the right platform or reference maybe. It is always a wiser option to choose
              you network to help you get a good job. Like many people you have in your network, the same  number of possibilities 
              and so the options are available. Count on them but you don’t need to completely depend on your network though
               you shouldn’t hesitate to look at them.</p>

               <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Add accomplishments</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>You put effort into achieving those goals and be proud of
                compiling them in your resume. The organization loves to know what efforts in your previous
                 companies and how hard you worked to grow the same. The accomplishment section in your
                  resume must sing the glories you have brought to the last organization by achieving 
                  the targets and covering that extra mile.  </p>

                  <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Build portfolio</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>A portfolio helps you present your skills and show the work you have 
               put in the efforts. It is always suggested to have a portfolio. May it is a freelance opportunity or a 
               job you are searching for, a portfolio helps you put your compiled work before the one you are presenting it. </p> 

                  <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Never say no to opportunities to begin</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>While you continue to search for a job, remain open to all kinds of
                opportunities. You may look for freelance options, an internship, training to upskill yourself, or any
                 other chance different from your niche. Say yes, it helps. Stay open to new things and opportunities 
                 to learn and unlearn as well. Keep in mind: “something is way better than nothing.”. </p> 
                
                
                 <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Induce experiences to your profile</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>Let the things get added to the list. Try to gain experiences from wherever
                possible. Don’t be too judgemental, and don’t settle for much less. It is always suggested to keep looking
                 for better opportunities, but it’s not a bad idea to work with the available options. </p> 

                 <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Consider job hunting as your full-time work</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>If you don’t have a job now, you must consider the job search like your 
               full-time activity. You have to be dedicated and prepared for the exact cause. You need to be determined
                to give your whole time to essential work.

                <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Personal branding is vital</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>Linkedin helps you with personal branding. It enables you to turn
                yourself into a brand. You must not forget to keep on working on your branding. It is always wiser
                 to go on hustling in multiple ways, and personal branding is one of the most reliable options to
                  choose for yourself and grow. You can continue your job hunt and, at the same time, put some
                   effort into personal branding by connecting with people and building networks. </p>

                
                <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Be consistent</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>Consistency is the key to success. Be consistent with your job search,
                personal branding, and upscaling the skills. Don’t get demotivated and discouraged easily. Building 
                an empire takes time and effort; it is not an overnight process. Trust the process and keep working
                 for the goal.  </p>

                <p className='font-semibold text-slate-700 text-2xl mt-10'>Be patient</p>
               <p className='mt-10 leading-loose'>There are two processes mainly: Selection and rejection. 
               Organizations sometimes have multiple openings and need more candidates; hence, they follow
                the selection process that results in more candidates getting selected. Sometimes the vacancy
                 is limited, and candidates are more in number, which results in following the rejection
                  process, concluding in the rejection of so many candidates.

               So, it is not YOU who was not eligible or qualified enough to get selected; sometimes,
                it is about the number of vacancies. Be patient and let the best come to you. Go on 
                 applying but also wait for the post-interview process or response.

                We wish that these pointers help you in your job search and provide you with the clarity
                 to have a productive job hunting.
